                <p class="text-center">When I first came to Washington and Lee, I wanted to be a computer science minor. During middle school and high school, I developed a love for coding that I wanted to continue exploring throughout college, and being a computer science minor seemed like the logical way to do that. However, during my first year, my advisor for the History major told me about the DCI minor at Washington and Lee, and I immediately fell in love with it. Although a computer science minor would have allowed me to continue exploring my love of coding, it would have had no connection with my other interests in the humanities. DCI, on the other hand, has allowed me to combine my passion for coding and the humanities, and I'm so glad for the experiences I've had as a DCI minor. My main goal when I chose to be a DCI minor was to improve my web development skills. As a DCI minor, not only have I accomplished that, but I have learned so much about my other passions. For example, without my DCI courses, I would never have been inspired to complete projects exploring questions about the effects of discrimination on minority groups, and I would never have realized my passion for social justice. This portfolio contains a collection of some of the amazing projects I have been able to complete as a DCI minor, and I hope viewing these projects and what I learned from completing them will inspire other Washington and Lee students also to consider becoming a DCI minor.</p>
