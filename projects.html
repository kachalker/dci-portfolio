            <p>Washington and Lee's DCI minor has six main learning outcomes that students are supposed to meet by completing the minor:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Develop critical capacities for analyzing the role of technology and digital media in contemporary culture, and apply those capacities to a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary inquiries.</li>
              <li>Develop the technical skills necessary for academic and professional success, with an emphasis on online communication and information.</li>
              <li>Demonstrate the ability to communicate across different media and to both academic and general audiences.</li>
              <li>Engage in collaborative, interdisciplinary, project-based learning.</li>
              <li>Develop digital projects that contribute to the scholarly conversation in the student's field of study and demonstrate an awareness of the technological and critical needs of the discipline.</li>
              <li>Develop an online professional identity and a portfolio of work in the minor.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Throughout my time at Washington and Lee, I have completed digital humanities projects in classes from multiple disciplines. Completing these projects has allowed me to accomplish the DCI minor's learning outcomes and has taught me other valuable lessons about web development, communication through digital mediums, and research methods. You can view some of the projects that I've created below.</p>
          </div>
          <h2>DCI-102: <a href="https://kachalker.github.io/LGBTQ_Olympic_Representation/index.html" target="_blank">Visualizing the History of LGBTQ+ Athletes in the Olympics</a></h2>
          <div class="projects-desc">
            <h3>DCI Learning Outcome I Met:</h3>
            <p>Through this project, I met the DCI learning outcomes of demonstrating the ability to communicate across different media and to both academic and general audiences and engaging in collaborative, interdisciplinary, project-based learning.</li></p>
            <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
            <p>This project taught me how to use various different softwares that are used to create visualizations such as Tableau. It also taught me the importance of clean data in digital humanities projects and it taught me how to correctly document the data that I used in the project.</p>
          </div>
          <h2>DCI-108: <a href="https://portfolio.chalkerk24.wludci.info/index.html" target="_blank">Personal Portfolio</a></h2>
          <div class="projects-desc">
            <h3>DCI Learning Outcome I Met:</h3>
            <p>Through this project, I met the DCI learning outcomes of developing the technical skills necessary for academic and professional success, with an emphasis on online communication and information and developing an online professional identity and a portfolio of work in the minor.</p>
            <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
            <p>This project taught the importance of creating wireframes before building a website and how to ensure my website is accessible for those with disabilities. This project also helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills. Although I knew how to write in HTML and CSS before creating this project, this project taught me how to write semantically correct code and it introduced me to Bootstrap.</p>
          </div>
          <h2>HIST-269C: <a href="https://kachalker.github.io/ghq-representation/index.html" target="_blank">Representing Native Americans in <cite>The Georgia Historical Quarterly</cite></a></h2>
          <div class="projects-desc">
            <h3>DCI Learning Outcome I Met:</h3>
            <p>Through this project, I met the DCI learning outcomes of developing critical capacities for analyzing the role of technology and digital media in contemporary culture, and applying those capacities to a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary inquiries and developing digital projects that contribute to the scholarly conversation in the student's field of study and demonstrating an awareness of the technological and critical needs of the discipline.</p>
            <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
            <p>This project allowed me to improve my text analysis skills. Before completing this project, I had only ever used Voyant for text analysis, but for the sake of this project, I had to learn how to use another text analysis software called AntConc. AntConc has different features than Voyant and using its different features allowed me to more fully understand all of the research questions that can be answered through text analysis.</p>
